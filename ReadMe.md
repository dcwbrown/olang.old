####OLang - Cross-platform Oberon compiler for 32 and 64 bit Unix/Linux/Windows.

Olang is Norayr Chilingarian's Vishap Oberon adapted to build more easily on a wider variety of modern platforms, including cygwin and native Windows. See notes.md for differences.

#####Building and installation summary

1. git clone https://github.com/dcwbrown/olang
2. cd olang
3. make full
4. make install

Step 4 requires root/administrator pivilege on most Unix/Linux systems and on native windows.

#####32 bit vs 64 bit versions

On Linux/Unix systems, the built compiler is specific to the machine size. For example building on 32 bit Ubuntu will create a 32 bit compiler, etc.

On Windows, both native, and under cygwin, it is possible to build both 32 bit and 64 bit compilers. 

For cygwin it depends on the cygwin setup file used (setup-x86.exe generates a 32 bit installation, and setup-x86_64.exe a 64 bit installation.) Both can be installed side by side. Use the start menu entries 'Cygwin Terminal' or 'Cygwin64 Terminal'.

For the Visual C\++ Build Tools, use the installation provided start menu entries 'Visual C\++ x86 Native Build Tools Command Prompt' or 'Visual C\++ x64 Native Build Tools Command Prompt'. 

#####Oberon type sizes

Type sizes are fixed across the 32 and 64 bit compilers as follows:
 - CHAR, SHORTINT: 8 bits.
 - INTEGER, REAL: 32 bits.
 - LONGINT, LONGREAL, SET: 64 bit.

#####Selecting gcc vs clang (Unix/Linux)

By default make uses the compiler defined in variable CC. This can be overriden by running 'export CC=gcc' or 'export CC=clang' from the command line before running make.
*Note*: be sure to run 'make clean' any time you change the value of CC. Otherwise directories will be mixed up.
*Note*: Darwin (MAC OS/X) redirects gcc to clang, so specifying CC=gcc still builds clang binaries.

#####Native windows

'make.cmd' is hardcoded to use 'cl', the Microsoft Visual C compiler. For other compilers on windows use cygwin. The compiler built by 'make.cmd' uses the WIn32 API directly - it does not depened on cygwin or other unix-like layers.
At the time of writing Microsoft provides a free command line Visual C compiler called the 'Visual C++ Build Tools 2015'. See:

#####Cygwin on Windows

Just as on Unix or Linux systems, make can build a gcc or clang based compiler for the cygwin environment on Windows. The generated compiler will depend on cygwin.dll.

#####MingW on Cygwin on Windows

Cygwin also provides packages for building MingW binaries. Although built with gcc these binaries use the Win32 API directly.

To build mingw compiler binaries, set up a cygwin environment, add the corresponding mingw package and set the CC environment variable as follows:

######For 32 bit cygwin

 - use setup-x86.exe to add the package mingw64-i686-gcc-core.
 - run 'export CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc'

######For 64 bit cygwin

 - use setup-x86_64.exe to add the package mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core.
 - run 'export CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc'

(*Note*: Don't be put off by the name 'mingw64' in the 32 bit package.)

Now run 'make full' and 'make install'. This will place the compiler and libraries in /opt/olang in the cygwin filesystem.

#####What make does

'make' starts one of three makefiles: 'GNUmakefile' for GNU make systems, 'makefile' on BSD systems, and 'make.cmd' on native Windows. 
All three first compile and run src/buildtools/configure.c, which establishes platform details including:

1. Platform type (unix/windows) and distribution (freebsd/ubuntu/raspbian/...).
2. C compiler command line for assembling olang output.
3. C compiler memory model - ILP32, LP64 or LLP64.
4. C compiler pointer variable alignment. (See SIZEALIGN in olang.make for details.)
5. Directory to install to for this system.

These are written to two files: 
 - Configuration.Mod will be compiled with olang *.Mod sources to embed platform details.
 - Configuration.make will be included by 'GNUmakefile'/'makefile'/'make.cmd' to provide the remainder of the make process with platform specific variables.

'GNUmakefile' and 'makefile' are just wrappers to run configure.c and then include src/olang.make. ('olang.make' uses only makefile syntax common to GNU and BSD. Running configure.c to determine makefile variabls needs to run during makefile parsing and the syntax for this differs between the GNU make and the older BSD make on Darwin) 

For Windows, make.cmd is coded to provide the same functionality as olang.make.

#####Bootstrapping.

The olang repository includes pre-prepared C source files used to build a baseline compiler binary when making a fresh enlistment.
The sources in the bootstrap directory are sufficient to build a compiler for all supported system types, but require the -T SIZEALIGN parameter. This compiler is then rebuilt (bootstrapped) on the target architecture so that the target SIZEALIGN gets embedded as the default settings for the compiler. The makefile takes care of this automatically in the 'translate' target used by 'make full' and 'make compiler'. The bootstrap process run automatically on a new enlistment of following a 'make clean'.
