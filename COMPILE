currently three bootstrap static binaries provided, for x86_64, x86, and armv6j_hardfp (works on raspberry pi) gnu/linux targets.

0) prerequisites: libc6-dev on debian, glibc-devel, glibc-static on fedora.
	
1) make with corresponding makefile
   if it's rasp pi or other armhf platform then do
   # make -f makefile.gcc.armv6j_hardfp
   if it's x86 then
   # make -f makefile.gcc.x86
   and if it's x86_64, then default makefile is for this platform
   # make

   (theoretically you can also change TARCH in makefile and type make)

2) # sudo make install

this will install voc in /opt/voc-<version> and create /opt/voc symlink to it.

add /opt/voc/bin to your PATH and enjoy, compile, have fun!
