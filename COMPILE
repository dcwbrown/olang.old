currently three bootstrap static binaries provided, for x86_64, x86, and armv6j_hardfp (works on raspberry pi) gnu/linux targets.

0) (* NOT NECESSARY ANYMORE *)
   copy statically compiled voc compiler for your platform as vocstatic.
   for instance, if your platform is armv6j_hardfp (like raspberry pi)
   # cp vocstatic.linux.gcc.armv6j_hardfp vocstatic
   and if your platform is x86 (32bit) gnu/linux then
   # cp vocstatic.linux.gcc.x86 vocstatic
   and if it's x86_64 then do nothing or
   # cp vocstatic.linux.gcc.x86_64 vocstatic

1) make with corresponding makefile
   if it's rasp pi or other armhf platform then do
   # make -f makefile.gcc.armv6j_hardfp
   if it's x86 then
   # make -f makefile.gcc.x86
   and if it's x86_64, then default makefile is for this platform
   # make

   (theoretically you can also change TARCH in makefile and type make)

2) # sudo make install

this will install voc in /opt/voc-<version> and create /opt/voc symlink to it.

add /opt/voc/bin to your PATH and enjoy, compile, have fun!
